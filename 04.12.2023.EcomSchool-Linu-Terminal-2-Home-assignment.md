ECOM: Linux Terminal 2 Homework Assignment
Hands-On Task: Data Processing and Analysis for Ecom Cyber students

Scenario:
You are a cybersecurity analyst working with a log file from a server. your only tool is your Linux Termianl and your task is to process the log file, extract specific information, and analyze the data for potential security issues.
The Server.log file is stored on a remote server and is accessable from this URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EcomSchool/ecomschool.github.io/main/server.log
# 
Task 1: Data Retrieval
Retrieve the log file to the terminal using either wget or curl.
# 
Task 2: Data Processing
Perform various operations on the log file:
Display the last 10 lines of GET requests.
Extract and sort IP addresses from GET requests.
Count the number of unique IP addresses in the log.
Count the total number of GET requests in the log.
# 
Task 3: Data Analysis
Analyze specific endpoint requests:
Find and display lines with the "/page1" endpoint.
Extract timestamps, status code and error messages for the first 5 requests to "/page1".
# 
Task 4: Summary
Write a summary based on the analysis results.

Note: Please make sure to document your commands and any outputs for each task. Submit your solutions along with the log file and your summary.

H) Write a summary based on the analysis results:
# 
Based on the analysis of the provided log file, here is a summary of the key findings:

Last 10 Lines of GET Requests:

The last 10 lines of GET requests were displayed, revealing the recent activity related to retrieving resources.
Extracted and Sorted IP Addresses from GET Requests:

Unique IP addresses involved in GET requests were extracted, sorted, and displayed. This provides insights into the distinct sources of these requests.
Count of Unique IP Addresses:

The total number of unique IP addresses in the log file was determined. This information helps in understanding the diversity of the sources accessing the server.

Count of Total GET Requests:

The total number of GET requests in the log file was counted, providing an overall measure of the frequency of this type of request.
Lines with "/page1" Endpoint:

Lines containing requests to the "/page1" endpoint were identified, allowing a focused analysis on this specific resource.
Timestamps, Status Codes, and Error Messages for First 5 "/page1" Requests:

Extracted timestamps, status codes, and error messages for the first 5 requests to "/page1" provide detailed information about the timing, success or failure, and specific error messages associated with these requests.
